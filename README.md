## Example Code

### Sum of Digits

```javascript
function sumOfDigits(num) {
    let sum = 0;
    while (num !== 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
    }
    return sum;
}
console.log(sumOfDigits(12345));  // Output: 15
```

### Finding Missing Number

```javascript
function findMissingNumber(arr) {
    let n = arr.length + 1;  // Since one number is missing
    let totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;  // Sum of first n natural numbers
    let currentSum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);  // Sum of array elements
    
    return totalSum - currentSum;
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];
console.log(findMissingNumber(arr));  // Output: 4
```
